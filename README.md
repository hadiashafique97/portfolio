# My Portfolio 

### By: Hadia Shafique

This is my portfolio featuring a home page, about, contact, and projects that showcase the projects I have worked on. On the About Me section the user has the ability to click on the Github logo that will redirect them to my Github account as well as the linkedIn logo that will redirect them to my linkedin. On the Projects page is a similar concept where as the github logo will redirect to the project and the Gogole logo will redirect user to the live link.
